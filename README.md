## OOP Part 2 - Inheritance of classes

**Step 1**
- Created an Animal class as our Parent Class

[Animal](https://github.com/MattSokol79/Python_OOP_2/blob/main/animal.py)

**Step 2**
- Created a Reptile class as child of the Animal Class
- Why? So we can Inherit from our Parent
class

[Reptile](https://github.com/MattSokol79/Python_OOP_2/blob/main/reptile.py)

**Step 3**
- Created a Snake class as child 
of the Reptile class

[Snake](https://github.com/MattSokol79/Python_OOP_2/blob/main/snake.py)

**Step 4**
- Created a Python class as a child 
of the Snake class
- This class has inherited EVERY method
from the other classes above it

### Name and Main
- `__name__ and __main__` are used to check if the code
is run from current file/directly for different
file/importing it
- We will create 2 files `__name__ and __main__` 
in both files and the outcome will show the 
difference
